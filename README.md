Building a program that (hopefully) will be a Chrome Extension. 

The idea is that with one click it will open a tab and generate randomly selected music from an array of youtube links. 
While coding & studying it would be nice to quickly and easily be able to get some ambient music playing in a tab without really having to type anything. 

Just click an icon on the browser and music starts playing. (like the Adblock button or the Gdrive button/extension.)  

(work in progress)
