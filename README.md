# Psychill



Psychill is a one click program embedded in the browser that automatically generates a random link to cool, ambient music. 
So that when you're studying or programming you don't have to dig through bookmarks or music sites looking for music to listen to. Just one click and the music starts playing in it's own tab. 

...so get to coding! \m/
